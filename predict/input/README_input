Inside the predict/input you will find

 - Files generated by running a replicate (#100) of the MODF simulated scenario 
 - Scripts to prepare the genomic data (simulated or real) in the format required to run each prediction method.

The commands should follow this sequence

1) 1_predict_inputs.sh to generate the initial input files required for all prediction methods
2) 2_run_beagle.sh to phase the data 
3) 3_run_haplocombi.sh to generate the genotype files for the four 2 by 2 combinations of parental haplotypes.
